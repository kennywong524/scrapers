I‚Äôm thinking of using this at times when I want to do no more than 3 hours. Took a ride recently that took me from Pasadena to Lancaster and I ended up driving about 30 miles back with no ride and working longer than I would‚Äôve like to. Wondering if setting a time for arrival back home can 1. Give you good enough amount of rides 2. Not take you very far. I‚Äôm assuming it would take you up to 30 miles away and only start taking into consideration the destination route when the time comes. True or false?,2021-08-15T20:48:03Z

Also, if you are in the ghetto, they want to keep you available there for PR purposes, even if there is no demand at all, so they disable the DF.  
They also kill it during large events, so you can't hope for a long surge trip to take you home. 
Offering the destination filter was one of the nicest things Uber did for the drivers, but it is becoming less reliable as a day-planning tool and I think Uber would like to make it disappear.",2018-10-26T10:08:39Z

I didn't switch my lyft direct on so lyft hasn't paid me for at least $320. I have contacted support 5 times. The last three time the support staff stated that they have escalated the issue to another department.
Now today, support has stone walled me. Not only is it demoralizing that lyft doesn't have a driver support phone number anymore, now they haven't sent me any notifications about my serious issue!
In the past, there has been a notification from support if I was ever owed missing earnings. Now there is No communication at all?
I sense some low moral at lyft. Are they on the verge of collapse?
You would think that the drivers would be the backbone of the company? More like the executives and the software engineers are the center of that company.
How would you contact outside of lyft if they would not communicate with you about your missing $320 ?

Hello, I'm Lyft's driver. I'll tell you. Lyft takes 70% and gives 30% to the driver. And when the car gets stuck in traffic, it charges passengers for traffic and gets all the money, but only about 0.45 cents to the driver. And when it arrives, it takes 5 minutes, which also charges passengers a lot of money and gives drivers 0.07 cents. Lyft and Uber need a thorough investigation",2023-12-20T21:10:56Z

I started doing ride share before I Left a abuse marriage now Im not sure about other cities but when I started in Knoxville in 2018 omg Lyft was king of the city here it's was like Uber who now I went with Uber because I was killing it because I was one of the few drivers here .. I only done it for a few months then I came back in May of 2021 and Uber is the king of Knoxville Tn now .. Lyft has ran  them in to the ground here by getting greedy... Uber we don't have upfront pricing here or most of the drivers don't even know where they're going until they swiping at the person in the car .. it's sad that both companies have totally forgotten about us drivers and in reality they have gotten to the point that they have totality lower the people we get from our airport.. not only that the next county over is Sevier county pigeon forge Gatlinburg Miss Dolly Parton biggest tourist area that thousands and thousands of people come all year around and how you can hardly get a ride share with either companies ain't no damn driver wants to set in horrible traffic for chump change it's a little over an hour from our airport to get up there one way and if you're coming back you're not going to back to where you need to get so you're pretty much rice and two and a half hours for like 33 bucks if that.. not only as drivers are putting our life in danger every day we get in our vehicle and pick complete strangers up is like my tax person said we're like waitresses who work for free pretty much we weren't really make money off your tips that we get from hard riderz our customers and honestly the only benefit is that we get our money's right now is bull crap in very sad that both companies have ended up this way yes totally I can say Lyft totally hands down as the better app but you can make way more and go Solo solo and don't be greedy damn like them.. companies need to realize my saying is company needs employees employees need companies let's have common sense treat your employees like family and you'll get a hard-working employee that will make you money and save you money... Hi people been saying this world has gotten pricey but  shitty ...

At major events, the surge pricing is so pathetic at Dodger Stadium, Staple Center, Sofi Stadium, etc. Last month, there was a rave by the Queen Mary and lots of ravers came to Long Beach. I saw a bunch of big Provost party buses to drive these people to & from the music festival bc Uber/Lyft drivers don't wanna deal with the road closures & traffic nightmare for chump change. They're hiding the true surge, at least on my app for sure bc I rent the car from Lyft. They know I'm gonna drive, surge or no surge bc I'm paying $250/week for their rental car. So I get less bonus, shitty ride challenges & no ride guarantees. The guys who rarely drive Lyft bc Uber pays more, they get the best Lyft earnings guarantees. Even though I been loyal to Lyft since 2018. It's like being married to an asshole who spends all his money on hookers but is stingy with his wife. They're never gonna reward you for being a loyal veteran. It just gets worse & worse. Minimum fare in this city was $2.62 in 2018 and it's still $2.62 in 2023. I leave those trips for the hookers to get their earning guarantee money. It's like they read the book ""Rules for Radicals"" and decided to apply it to rideshare.

Ok I will admit the truth.... I set it for my address that's not the dumbest part. Then I immediately started driving home. My only poor excuse is doing it 60-155 miles from home.

las vegas strip, destination SE (near henderson) about 7-10 miles away.  
ill get rides straight east, north east, NORTH!!! or straight south.....all which are putting me more miles from home than where im at.    
like you say you do past home, but that ends up putting me 5-10 miles away from home, PAST my home, which is ""empty miles""
best it usually does is drop me at the airport, which cuts my dead miles in half heading home.  

oddly enough, the filter isnt ""always available"" here especially during surge times.  
ASAP, or a time...ive tried both.  i get the same results.  ive had one time both rides sent me north.  i took the first one considering how dumb it was directional wise but it paid $20 to go 4 miles straight north, so it was well worth it.  then when i was north it took me straight south basically where i was at when i set the filter.  

i find cherry picking to have better luck....and been within a mile of home.  

now, maybe its because i am in such a short distance it does not work well.",2024-01-16T20:56:47Z

2024-08-22T02:53:13Z,@FRMillionaires,P4pfSelbMNg,"That is incorrect. 

When you drive 12 hours with Lyft, you have to take a 6-hour break. 

So if you start at 5 am (when the day starts with Lyft) and drive until 5 pm, that's 12 hours. 

After a 6-hour break, it will be 11 pm, and you can drive 6 more hours until 4:59 am. 

That means you can drive a maximum of 18 hours a day! (Though not recommended I have done it before).

I can tell you for a fact that lift would offer these bonuses as well as a streak bonuses but here is the problem I encountered... location filter was not offered as an option ever in Albuquerque New Mexico, when you're working a certain Zone to get that streak you have to do all three rides in that zone so you get one ride and you think you're off to a good start then the second ride they offer you takes you out of the zone and breaks the freaking streak, this is deliberate and if you cancel that ride to stay in the zone then that also breaks your streak so the bonus is immediately gone and nullified and this is just a BS game buy lift the Trap you and draw you in so you work the market the way they want you to work it and you get a 2 and 3 and 4 dollar ride? We are paying for vehicles, we are paying for gas oil tires brakes and we make car payments insurance payments cell phone payments and some of us have extended warranties to cover major repairs.  It's possible this guy just made this video to make money off of YouTube and if you did good for him it's a clever way to use the lift platform in a different medium to make some money. Guys these companies are making hundreds of billions of dollars off of our back our vehicles off of the money we spend and the blood and sweat we pour out to pay our bills and pay for their Fleet we are the fleet for Uber and Lyft this needs to make it to legislation and there needs to be laws governing how this gig companies operate and work with us instead of use us and exploit us and that's only going to happen if we come together and work together as one unified body and that's what makes the unity of many people working towards one goal so beautiful and that is the heart and spirit of America I find it interesting that England and Australia are kind of ahead of us in telling these gig companies what they can and cannot do and they have shut them down and made it impossible for them to continue exploiting their citizens as drivers also this is a state by state thing in the United States where some states are winning victories and holding Uber and Lyft accountable and winning a lot of Victories against Uber getting 35 to 38 an hour plus they make their tips plus mileage. We must find this unity in each Rideshare community in every single market across the United states.

The key to making more $$ within the hour is by taking more rides, but this is in reality a LOT more work cause you deal with 10 riders instead of 1 rider (for drivers with longer trip rides).  So at the end, your hassle is paid for handsomely.  It is FAIR.  Lyft and Uber need to offer these streak bonuses cause short rides are not that attractive to take. Without the bonus, most drivers don't want to take these $6, $8 rides when they can take $20 rides that are equally profitable per mile per minute.",2024-07-08T23:36:07Z

I'm surprised if I see $5 surge pricing in Newark/Jersey City NJ!  we NEVER see pink areas with $12.  Those surge areas mean there hasn't been a driver in the area for such an extended amount of time that they feel they need to offer $12.  Plus... have you even heard of ""Priority"" mode?? I wouldn't be surprised if you haven't.  Priority mode forces hordes of drivers to take diminished rates in exchange for ""more"" rides.  If you don't use Priority Mode you keep regular rates but you're last to get booked.  People think your fake cause they don't get that you're in a perfect storm of a market.  maybe you should try driving in NJ for 2 weeks just as an experiment  and see what you think",2024-03-21T22:31:49Z

Today I sat in surge zones for over an hour, I did not get 1 ride! When I finally turned on Priority mode, OMG!!!! Its a miracle! A ride popped up.  Us Drivers need to pull together...
I've been a rideshare driver now for 8 years. Without us they wont have a business. just something to think about. 

If you read the info on Lyft it says they pay you less, but you get more rides. That means Drivers will drive more and SPEND More Money on Gas and Put More Miles on Your Vehicle! 
Drivers, lets say NO to Lyft! 
If Drivers STOP using Priority Mode Lyft will be forced to close the mode. Or at the very least use it and then end after each ride. I do this a lot anyways so I can find a close by surge opportunity.

Touch this and you will see the filters you can choose from. You only have 2 filters to use within a 24 hr period if you are silver. Gold, you jump up to 3 filters per 24 hr period. ‚ÄúStay within Area‚Äù is the filter that is very cost effective for saving gas.

My point is the money you're making is definitely indicative on the area you're working The bonuses they offer where I am are I'm working our difficult to obtain streaks are not consistent. I've often wondered if there are some sort of algorithm to prevent you from making them or maybe because I'm not driving a brand new Tesla or Audi or other fantastic car and I only have a 2014 very nice and clean Honda Civic maybe I'm not getting the rides others are getting even though I've been doing this for a number of years,2023-06-24T19:05:33Z

1) What are your earnings after the maintaince and insurance expenses?. $71/hr sounds sexy but after all your expenses that can easily drop to <$35/hr

2) How long have you been a driver? Aka are you still in your honeymoon phase with Lyft? This is usually up to 6-9 months.

3) Even with SIA filter, how long do you stay in that area? And are you part time or full time driver?

4) Lastly, do you understand how to determine your operating costs per hour/day to break even and do you with this strategy  reliably?",2023-06-24T18:51:56Z

That doesn't include the strategy I talk about in this video because I first started using it in March. I used to make ‚âà $450 per gas tank but this new strategy helps me make ‚âà $800 per gas tank. With gas being the biggest expense, I can say with confidence that I'm not spending that much on maintenance. Previously, as I only averaged like $6-$8 an hour in expenses. I'll do a follow up soon. 

2. Since October 2020. 

3. I stay in the same area all day unless I get a great long distance ride through an app called Skeddy that automatically finds me long rides: https://youtu.be/nqbSj2uHzAE

But I think you exaggerate there a bit when you say earning $71hr, and netting $35hr after expenses. I've been an independent driver since the mid 90's as a messenger/courier with own vehicle. Never was in the red. I am now a company employee truck driver. Try owning your own tractor trailer. Now those, my friend, are expenses. Tractor payment, diesel, insurance (truck and cargo)  permits/licensing, monthly maintenance, repairs, tire blowouts, and with rates being low, thanks to alot of crook freight brokers.

Then you‚Äôll be declining the cheap rides and ruining gold status.  If you lose gold then you can only see how far away the customer is and not how far the ride will be.",2024-11-20T22:45:36Z

2024-10-09T15:15:58Z,@baronerth,v1q2fLJK7vk,"If you want to skip the video, here is the hack:
1: Get a ride to the airport
2: You have an excellent chance to get a pickup when dropping off at the airport immediately
3: Airport rides are more common early in the morning
4: Use your saved time  to eat a yogurt
